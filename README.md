Graphed Sony's Stock Data

The dataset used for this project is the historical stock price data for Sony obtained from the Yahoo Finance library. In this fine, I cleaned and observed the data. I then graphed the data mostly focusing on the period during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. I wanted to observe the trend of Sony's closing price and also observe how Sony's stock price is affected during events that involve the PlayStation 5.
